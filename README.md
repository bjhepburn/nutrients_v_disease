# Undernourishment as a factor of chronic illness

This project attempts to answer the questions: 
    Does malnourishment have an effect on chronic illnesses?
    Is the United States representative of the world in this regard?
    Is Houston representative of as well?

The goal was to collect and clean data concerning nutrient deficiency, median income, and chronic illess prevalence on a global, national and local level.

Our hypothesis was that there would be a strong positive correlation between malnourishment and income and malnourishment and chronic illess.

Our hypothesis proved false, we saw no strong correlation between nutrient deficiency and chronic illess, in fact, there was a stronger negative correlation between malnourishment and cancer, which indicates that areas getting less nourishment, are also getting less cancer.

Our ultimate conclusions were stymied by a lack of raw data, there not being any tables available providing strong data on deficiencies in specific nutrients across any of the three scaled regions.
